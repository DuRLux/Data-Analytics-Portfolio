# Theft From Motor Vehicles Data Cleaning and Exploration

The dataset was obtain from a public data base link is here https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/datasets/TorontoPS::theft-from-motor-vehicle-open-data/about
The main purpose of this dataset is to give people a general idea of which areas of Toronto are most prone to theft

My goal is to identify where and when thefts occur the most.

I am first required to clean the data and remove unwanted columns for my analyst.
After that I then explored the data to uncover some interesting findings.

Please view my SQL and my Power Bi file to find my findings.
